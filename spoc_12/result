Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  io
  io
  yld
  cpu
  yld

Process 1
  yld
  io
  yld
  yld
  yld

Important behaviors:
  System will switch when the current process is FINISHED or ISSUES AN YIELD or IO
  After IOs, the process issuing the IO will run LATER (when it is its turn)
